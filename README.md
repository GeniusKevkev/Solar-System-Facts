# Solar-System-Facts 
In this repository. You will be learning mainly about the solar system! Facts would also be listed and update! I hope you look and enjoy!
Sun 
The biggest, hottest, and most dangerous objects in our solar system. The sun. It is 696340 km in radius! Imagine how big is that! Due to its nuclear fission in the center of the sun, the sun would become much bigger and swallow venus and destroy Earth’s atmosphere! In this case, there will be no more life to exist on Earth! The sun’s surface is 5600 celsius and down to its core where all the pressure is 15,000,000 celsius!!!! The sun is a ball of gas, which inside is made of 91.0% hydrogen and 8.9% helium. By mass, the Sun is about 70.6% hydrogen and 27.4% helium. Hydrogen inside the sun’s core has been cleared/pressured into helium atoms! Here are some fun facts about the sun!
The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in the solar system.
Over one million Earths could fit inside the Sun.
The Sun is almost a perfect sphere.
The Sun is travelling at 220 km per second.
The Sun will eventually be about the size of Earth.
It takes eight minutes for light to reach Earth from the Sun. 
The Sun rotates in the opposite direction to Earth


Mercury 
Mercury is the smallest terrestrial planet in our solar system! It is 2439.7 km in ( Radius ) and is 59.617 million km from the sun! Due to the closeness of Mercury is to the sun, Mercury is getting smaller and also Mercury’s atmosphere was burned away from the sun. Mercury is also one of the slowest rotating planets because it doesn’t moon which keeps it stable! For every 2 orbits of the Sun, which takes around 88 Earth days, Mercury completes three rotations of its axis. Mercury also has insane temperatures! On its sunny side, Mercury can reach a scorching 800 degrees Fahrenheit! On its cold side, Mercury can reach a freezing -300 degrees Fahrenheit!

Venus
Venus is the hottest terrestrial planet that can reach a scorching temperature of more than 880 degrees Fahrenheit and is 6051.8 Km ( Radius ) in size close to the size of Earth!  Woah! Venus is 108.47 million Km from the sun ( Way farther than Mercury is to the sun) and it is hotter than Mercury? Well, why? This is because Venus’ atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide and sulphur oxide which traps the sun’s radiation and heat!!! We know that we have the ozone layer that reflects radiation and less carbon dioxide that reflects/ doesn’t trap the sun’s heat. Well, Venus is the opposite. Although Venus looks like a beautiful planet, underneath its catastrophic clouds are full of acid rain and raging volcanos. Since then, NASA and other missions did not recommend probes or rockets to go there. A fun and interesting fact about Venus is that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus! Here are more interesting facts about Venus
Unlike the other planets in our solar system, Venus spins opposite.
 Venus is the second brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon
Venus has 90 times the atmospheric pressure of Earth
Earth 
Earth is the only planet that has valuable water and life on it. It is a very unique planet to exist. Although in a couple hundred million years the sun would burn away the Earth’s atmosphere. Earth is in the habitable orbit and has all the conditions to support life! Earth is the biggest terrestrial planet in our solar system! Earth is 6371 km in radius and 147.11 million km from the sun! It has a strong magnetic field and atmosphere to keep us alive. Here are some fun facts to learn about!
Plate Tectonics Keep the Planet Comfortable:
Earth is Almost a Sphere, it is more like an oval!
Earth is Mostly Iron, Oxygen and Silicon
70% of the Earth’s Surface is Covered in Water:
The Earth’s Atmosphere Extends to a Distance of 10,000 km:
The Earth’s Molten Iron Core Creates a Magnetic Field:

Mars
Mars is a red planet. Yea red! Well, why? Mars is made from the icon, oxygen, iron, magnesium and probably has the consistency of soft rocky paste. These materials make Mars red! Mars is 3389.5 km in radius ( Approximately Half Of Earth ) and is 228.46 million km from the sun. Mars has one of the biggest sandstorms and has the world’s tallest volcanoes in the whole solar system! Olympus Mons is the tallest mountain in our solar system. It is about 72000 ft which is 21 km high! That is almost 4 times higher than Earth’s tallest mountain ( Mount Everest )! You would see Olympus Mon in a telescope! Do you like to examine moons, well Mars also has some moons named Phobos ( a very small moon ) and Deimos! Although Phobos is going to crash on Mars in millions of years! Here are some facts about Mars. 

Asteroid Belt
Asteroid Belt, yeah asteroid Belt. Full of Asteroids and minor comets! The biggest asteroid in the asteroid belt is Ceres! It is 473 km in radius and if you think that is small, compare it to our moon. It can smash our moon into pieces! The asteroid belt is about 2.2 and 3.2 astronomical units far away from the sun!


Jupiter
Jupiter the biggest planet and the most ferocious planet in our solar system! Jupiter is 69911 km in radius and has winds up to 680 km/h!!!!! Jupiter also has one of the most ferocious storms in the whole solar system!!! The great red spot! It has been more than 400 years on Jupiter! Due to Jupiter’s gravitational force and magnetic field, Jupiter has more than 67 moons and did you know that Jupiter has a slight ring?! Jupiter is also one of the most supportable planets in our solar system. If there is no Jupiter, the asteroid belt would smash into Earth!

Saturn
Most dense ( Because Saturn is almost all made out of air )
Saturn is the most distant planet that can be seen with the naked eye.
Saturn was known to the ancients, including the Babylonians and Far Eastern observers.
Saturn is the flattest planet.
Saturn orbits the Sun once every 29.4 Earth years.
Saturn’s upper atmosphere is divided into bands of clouds.
Saturn has oval-shaped storms similar to Jupiter’s.

Uranus
Uranus was officially discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781.
Uranus turns on its axis once every 17 hours, 14 minutes.
Uranus makes one trip around the Sun every 84 Earth years.
Uranus is often referred to as an “ice giant” planet.
Uranus hits the coldest temperatures of any planet.
Uranus has two sets of very thin dark coloured rings.
Only one spacecraft has flown by Uranus.
Neptune
Neptune is the most distant planet from the Sun.
Neptune is the smallest gas giant.
A year on Neptune lasts 165 Earth years.
Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea.
Neptune has 6 faint rings.
Only one spacecraft has flown by Neptune.

Pluto, Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud
Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006.
Pluto has five known moons.
Pluto is the largest dwarf planet.
Pluto is one-third water/ice.
Pluto is smaller than a number of moons.
Pluto sometimes has an atmosphere.
The Kuiper Belt could contain hundreds of thousands of icy bodies that range in size from small chunks of ice to world lets larger than 100 kilometres across.
Astronomers have tracked most short-period comets from their origins in the Kuiper Belt. These are comets with orbital periods of 200 years or less.
There could be more than a trillion comet nuclei in the main body of the Kuiper Belt.
The largest Kuiper Belt Objects are Pluto, Quaoar, Makemake, Haumea, Ixion, and Varuna. These are often also referred to as Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs).
The first mission to the Kuiper Belt and beyond will fly by Pluto in July 2015. It’s called New Horizons and will survey Pluto, Charon and the other moons before heading out to study other Kuiper Belt Objects in the future.
Astronomers have found structures similar to our Kuiper Belt around at least nine other stars. Hubble Space Telescope imaged discs around the stars HD 138664 in the constellation Lupus and HD 53143 in the constellation Carina.
The ices in the Kuiper Belt date back to the formation of the solar system. They contain clues to conditions in the early solar nebula.
Objects in the Oort Cloud are also referred to as Trans-Neptunian objects. This name also applies to objects in the Kuiper Belt.
Some astronomers theorize that the Sun may have captured Oort Cloud cometary material from the outer disks of other stars that were forming in the same nebula as our star.
The Oort Cloud is a reserve of cometary nuclei that contain ices dating back to the origin of the solar system.
